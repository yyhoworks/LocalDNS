# Mihomo host bypass and return rule guard

An optional OpenRC integration for the existing VM gateway design. LocalDNS
does not require this service on ordinary installations.

This integration expects the existing, root-owned `/etc/init.d/mihomo-return`,
`/etc/conf.d/mihomo-return`, `/usr/local/sbin/mihomo-ipv6` and
`/etc/conf.d/mihomo-ipv6` scripts. It uses their configured interface, gateways,
IPv6 TProxy port and existing marks/tables. It is not a generic firewall manager.

`guard.py --check` inspects the actual firewall and policy routing without
changing them. `--ensure --wait 15` restores missing IPv4/IPv6 rules through the
existing scripts, then verifies the resulting state. A shared lock serializes
the reload hook and background recovery. Healthy rules are not rewritten.
Missing/incomplete Mihomo core chains are treated as not ready; the guard does
not create them or restart the core.

`openrc` runs the guard every two seconds under `supervise-daemon`. When a
repair does not restore health (or an error repeats), retries back off
exponentially up to 300 seconds and reset once healthy. Only changes in health,
the remaining issue list or the error are logged, plus successful repairs. The existing proxy
configuration service uses `post-reload-mihomo.sh` for synchronous validation.
Direct API reloads that bypass that hook are covered by the periodic guard;
there can be a brief recovery interval after such a reload.

## `--check` output contract

`guard.py --check` prints exactly one JSON object on stdout, so a monitor can
parse it without handling tracebacks. The exit code is 0 only for a healthy
state.

| State | Payload | Exit |
|---|---|---|
| Healthy | `{"ok": true, "ready": true, "ipv4": [], "ipv6": []}` | 0 |
| Rules missing or misplaced | `{"ok": false, "ready": true, "ipv4": [...], "ipv6": [...]}` | 1 |
| Configuration or command failure | `{"ok": false, "error": "..."}` | 1 |

The failure payload is deliberately minimal: it carries no `ready`, `ipv4` or
`ipv6` keys, so read `error` first and only fall back to the health fields when
it is absent. Configuration is read before the firewall snapshot, so a host
with missing `/etc/conf.d` files fails fast instead of running `iptables-save`
first.

## Installation on a matching VM

Back up the current firewall, policy routes, scripts and reload hook first.
Prepare a scoped rollback that preserves unrelated firewall changes. Validate
the existing scripts and run `guard.py --check` before installation.

Install `guard.py` as `/usr/local/sbin/mihomo-return-guard.py`, `openrc` as
`/etc/init.d/mihomo-return-guard`, and the hook at the already configured
`postReload` path. All three should be root-owned and mode `0750`. Run the hook,
enable the guard with `rc-update add mihomo-return-guard default`, then start
it with `rc-service mihomo-return-guard start`.

Verify each domestic DNS resolver, explicit foreign SOCKS5/DoH/ECS paths,
LAN proxy traffic, IPv6 and a controlled configuration reload. Service status
alone is not a firewall health check. Stop the guard before intentionally
changing this VM's bypass/return design.
